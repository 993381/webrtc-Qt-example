webrtc-Qt-example
=================

this is a typical video chat example of webrtc with Qt. it developed from 
google code project webrtc. it also "borrowed" code from webrtc
project.(locate in trunk\talk\examples\peerconnection directory)

note:
because webrtc project have signal and slot as Qt dose,so there might
have some problems to compile this example.
to compile this example, you should have: Qt5.3 lib with VS2013(recommend).
